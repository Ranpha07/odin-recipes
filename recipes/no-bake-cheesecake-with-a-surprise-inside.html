    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These delightful, individual cheesecakes have a sweet surprise inside them. Serve them to guests and watch their faces when they slice into the center to find a chocolate covered strawberry. The strawberry is covered with a thick, soft, chocolate ganache that is easy to slice with a fork.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>Graham Cracker Crust:
        <li>1 cup graham cracker crumbs (from 8-9 graham crackers)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Chocolate Covered Strawberries:
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>8 ounces dark chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>6 large strawberries</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Cheesecake Filling:
        <li>1/4 cup cold water/li>
        <li>1 Tbsp powdered gelatin (1-1/2 packages)</li>
        <li>3 packages (8 ounces each) of cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2-1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>Graham Cracker Crust:
        <li>Place the graham crackers, sugar, and butter in a bowl and stir it until it looks like wet sand and it holds together when you pinch it.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture into the bottom of six 3-inch pans. Place them in the refrigerator to chill while you make the filling.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>Chocolate Covered Strawberries:
        <li>Line a plate with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the heavy cream in the microwave or in a saucepan over medium heat on the stove. Only heat it until it gently simmers and don't let it boil.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot cream into the chopped chocolate and let it sit for a few minutes until the chocolate melts. Once the chocolate melts, stir it until it is smooth.</li>
        <li>Slice the green leaves off of the strawberries and dip them into the chocolate ganache.</li>
        <li>Place the chocolate-covered straberries on the parchment-lined plate and set them in the fridge to get firm.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>Cheesecake Filling:
        <li>Put the cold water in a microwavable bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Set the gelatin aside to soften (or bloom) for at least 5 minutes while you beat the cream cheese. </li>
        <li>Place the cream cheese in a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer until it is smooth and there are no lumps.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar, vanilla, and salt and beat until smooth and creamy. Make sure you scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate all the ingredients well.</li>
        <li>Stire in the heavy cream by hand. Don't use an electric beater for this step or the mixture will get too thick to easily pour into the cheesecake pans.</li>
        <li>Place the softened gelatin in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds, stirring at 10-second intervals. Heat it until it is completely dissolved and liquid. If it is too hot, let it sit for a few minutes until it is comfortably warm.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the warm gelatin into the cream cheese mixture and stir it until it is well incorporated.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>Making the Mini Cheesecakes:
        <li>Place the chocolate-covered strawberries in the center of each of the mini pans. </li>
        <li>Line the inside of the mini pans with a strip of acetate sheets.</li>
        <li>Spoon or pipe the filling over the chocolate covered strawberries inside the mini cheesecake pans and smooth the tops. Cover them with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or <strong>preferably overnight</strong>. </li>
        <li>When ready to serve, push up on the bottoms of the cheesecake pans and remove the individual cheesecakes.  Transfer them to a serving plate and remove the acetate sheets. garnish with strawberries or mint leaves.</li>
        <li>To get a clean, pretty slice, dip a sharp knife in hot water then slowly slide it through the center of the cheesecakes. </li>
    </ol>
